# About mod

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> THIS MOD IS BASED ON [[simfphys] Better Crash Damage & Derby Support by D MAS](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2183087063)!
> If you use only Simfphys vehicle, install the original mod. It will be better.

This mod increases crash damage and allows to deal collision damage to all LVS and Simfphys vehicles (Even if LVS vehicle crashes into Simfphys vehicle and vice versa).
LVS cars take damage by the engine, another LVS and Simfphys vehicles take damage by the frame.
